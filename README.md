Simply Books is essentially a React and NextJS version of a previous NSS assignment called Almost Amazon. A user can add a list of books and authors to their collection.

[View App](https://elfrey-simply-books.netlify.app/)

## Get Started
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ericlfrey/IN-CLASS-simply-books.git

$ cd IN-CLASS-simply-books
```

## About the Project 
This was a great learning tool for implementing React with a NextJS framework, learning how to layout code and use NextJS routing. The app also uses Google Authentication and a Firebase database with API calls.

## Features 
An authorized user can sign in and add their own books/authors, edit the info, view info on both the books and authors using complex data calls, and then delete them out of the list if needed. Deleteing an author also deletes all books assosiated with that author. This achieves full CRUD using Google Firebase.
